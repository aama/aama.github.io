	  <h5>Details</h5>

	  <ol>
	    <li id="project"> 
	      <h5>Introduction: The AAMA Project</h5>
	      <p>The purpose of the AAMA Project is to create a morphological
		archive whose data can be:
		<ul>
		  <li>curated (edited/created) -- and hopefully shared!</li>
		  <li>inspected</li>
		  <li>manipulated</li>
		  <li>queried</li>
		</ul>
		on individual browsers.</p> 
	      <p>In the first instance
		the archive should  make available and comparable the major 
		morphological paradigms of some forty Cushitic and Omotic languages,
		and in the longer term help situate the morphologies of these 
		two language families within Afroasiatic. In the longer run
		we hope also that the archive and its accompanying software
		may serve as a tool for exploration of typology and structure 
		of the form of linguistic organization known as the paradigm.
	      </p>
	      <p>As presently configured tha AAMA project consists of 
		three interconnected modules:</p>
	      <ol>
		<li><h6>Data Files</h6>
		  <p>An extensible collection of <a href="#datafiles"> data 
		      files</a>  in <a href="#datastructure">edn</a> format
		    or morphological paradigms from Afroasiatic languages.
		    The data is application-neutral, and could be cast into any plausible
		    datastore format, and used in conjunction with tools and query-and-display
		    applications constructed using any appropriate programming tools.</p>
		  <p>Presently archived files cover the verbal and pronominal
		    morphological paradigms of thirty-three Cushitic and
		    six Omotic languages. In addition there are files
		    with parallel data covering five Semitic languages and two varieties
		    of Egyptian -- limited Berber and Chadic data is in the process
		    of being entered. The intention behind the project is to extend the scope
		    of the archive to include eventually as complete a 
		    representation  as possible of all branches of 
		    the Afroasiatic language complex.<em> Any or all the the data files
		    can be downloaded from the AAMA site, and 
		    corrections to the existing files and submission, for on-line
		    sharing, of new language files are hereby sollicited!</em></p>
		</li>
		<li><h6>RDF Datastore</h6>
		  <p>The data archive will hopefully serve a number of 
		    research and reference purposes. One such purpose is the creation of a 
		    queriable datastore, and to this end we have set up such a datastore
		    using the W3C-sanctioned  <a href="https://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a> format. 
		    Pending an on-line publicly accessible datastore, you
		    can set one up on your own  computer. Instructions
		    are given below for setting up an RDF server on an individual 
		    machine, and loading the data into it.</p>
		</li>
		<li><h6>Query/Display Interface</h6>
		  <p>There is an experimental web application for 
		    querying and displaying data from the archive. 
		    Below we give instructions for 
		    downloading, launching, and initializing it. More details 
		    are on the app are available in the aama/webapp 
		    <a href="https://github.com/aama/webapp/blob/master/README.md">
		      README</a> and the app <code>Help</code> menu.<p>
		</li>
	      </ol>
	    </li>
	    <li id="software">
	      <h5>Install and configure required software</h5>
	      <ol>
		<li>
		  <h6>Git client</h6>
		  <p>The aama project uses <a
		  href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> to store data
		  and tools; you'll need a git client in order to
		  download the tools repository and the data
		  repositories you're interested in.  Follow the
		  instructions at <a
		  href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-mac">Set
		  Up Git</a>.
		  </p>
		  <p>Note that you do not need to create a github
		  account unless you want to edit the data or code.
		  Instructions for how to do that are below.
		  </p>
		</li>
		<li>
		  <p>
		    Create and switch to an <code>aama</code> directory
		    structure on your local drive, e.g.
		    <pre>
~/ $ mkdir aama
~/ $ cd aama</pre>
		  </p>
		</li>
		<li>
		  <h6>rdf2rdf.jar</h6>
		  <p>We use this tool to convert RDF files to various
		  formats.  <a
		  href="http://www.l3s.de/~minack/rdf2rdf/">Download
		  it</a> and save it someplace convenient -
		  <code>~/aama/jar</code> is a good place.
		  </p>
		</li>
		<li>
		  <h6>Fuseki</h6>
		  <p>
		    Fuseki is the SPARQL server we are using to query the dataset.  <a
		    href="http://jena.apache.org/download/index.cgi">Download</a>
		    the <code>apache-jena-fuseki-2.4.0-distribution</code>
		    distribution (either the zip file or the tar file; NB, make
		    sure your Java JDK is up-to-date with the download)
		    and store it in a convenient location.
		    <code>~/aama/fuseki</code> is a good place.
		   The following steps will install the <code>aama</code> dataset
		    and verify that it runs. Futher information about Fuseki, 
		    as well as information and links about RDF linked data and
		    the SPARQL query language can be found at the
		    <a href="http://jena.apache.org/index.html"> Apache Jena</a> 
		    site. </p>
		</li>
	      </ol>
	    </li>
	    <li id="datatools">
	      <h5>Download data and tools</h5>
	      <ul>
		<li>
		  <p>Take a look at the <a
		  href="https://github.com/aama">Aama repositories</a> and
		  decide which languages interest you.  In general we use
		  one repository per language, or in some cases, language 
		  variety, e.g. <a
		  href="https://github.com/aama/beja-arteiga">beja-arteiga</a>,
		  <a
		      href="https://github.com/aama/beja-bishari">beja-bishari</a>,
		  etc.
		  </p>
		  <p>Now you need to download the data to your local
		  harddrive.  Create a <code>data</code> directory
		  inside the <code>aama</code> directory,
		  e.g. <code>~/aama $ mkdir data</code>. Then clone
		  each language repository into the data directory:
		  </p>
		  <pre>
~/ $ cd aama/data
~/aama/data $ git clone https://github.com/aama/afar.git
~/aama/data $ git clone https://github.com/aama/geez.git
~/aama/data $ git clone https://github.com/aama/yemsa.git</pre>
		  <p>
		    Alternatively, you can create a personal github
		    account, <i>fork</i> the aama repositories (copy them
		    to your account), and then clone your repositories to
		    your local drive.  See <a
		    href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo">Fork
		    a Repo</a> for details.
		  </p>
		</li>
		<li>
		  <p>
		    In the same <code>aama</code> directory, clone the
		    aama <a href="https://github.com/aama/tools">tools
		    repository</a>:
		    <pre>
~/aama $ git clone https://github.com/aama/tools.git</pre>
		    and the <a href="https://github.com/aama/webapp"> web
		      application</a>:
		    <pre>
~/aama $ git clone https://github.com/aama/webapp.git</pre>
		  </p>
		</li>
	      </ul>
	      <p>
		When you're done, your directory structure should look
		like this (assuming you have cloned afar, geez, and
		yemsa):
	      </p>
		<pre>
   aama
   |-data
   |---afar
   |---geez
   |---yemsa
   |-fuseki
   |-jar
   |-tools
   |-webapp
		</pre>
	    </li>
	    <li id="ednformat">
	      <h5>The EDN format for morphological data</h5>

	      <p> The normative/persistant data format is the json-like 
		<a href="https://github.com/edn-format/edn">edn:  Extensible 
		  Data Notation</a>. This notation has the advantage of being
		rigorously defined system of terms (<code>:term</code>),
		strings (<code>"string"</code>), vectors 
		(<code>[a b c d]</code> maps (<code>{a b, c d}</code> and sets 
		(<code>#{a b c d}</code>, and thus reliably transformable 
		into a consistent RDF notation, while  at the same time 
		providing a human-readable natural format for data-entry and 
		inspection.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		Our current EDN structure (cf. <a href="#datastructure">below</a>)
		while open to extension and revision,
		seems to provide a natural notation for the verbal and 
		pronominal inflectional paradigms encountered in Afroasiatic,
		and perhaps for inflectional paradigms generally. </p>
             <p>
	       Since the EDN file is the normative/persistant data format,
	       any corrections or additions you want to make must be made 
	       in this file, from which you will then generate new TTL/RDF 
	       files to be  uploaded to the SPARQL server. And in fact, as 
	       long as you observe the above structure for EDN 
	       files, you can create any number of new language files of your
	       own, transform them to RDF format, and upload them to the
	       SPARQL server for querying.
	       </p>
	    </li>
	    <li id="rdfgen">
	      <h5>Generate RDF data from morphological data files</h5>
	      <p>
		In order to convert EDN-format data files to TTL ("turtle" 
		-- a more easily human-readable RDF format), you will
		need the <code>aama-edn2ttl.jar</code> file.
		You will find this file in the <code>~/aama/tools/clj</code> 
		directory, which also contains its source-code. You should
		move this file to wherever you saved the rdf2rdf.jar file
		(for example in <code>~/aama/jar</code>), which in turn will
		convert the .ttl file to the rdf-xml which is needed for
		uploading to the Fuseki SPARQL service.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		The EDN->TTL->RDF conversion can be effected by running:
		<pre>
~/aama $ tools/bin/aama-edn2rdf.sh "data/*"
                </pre>
		which will make a .ttl and .rdf file for every .edn file
		in the data/ directory. This script presumes that the two
		jar files have been placed in <code>~/aama/jar</code>; you
		should edit it if the jar files have been located elsewhere.
		(The conversion of a single language file can be effected by
		substituting, e.g., <code>data/oromo</code> for 
		<code>"data/*"</code>.) 
		</p>
	    </li>
	    <li id="rdfupload">
	      <h5>Upload RDF data to SPARQL service</h5>
	      <p>
		In order to upload the RDF files to Fuseki, you must
		first start the server by running:
		<pre>
~/aama $ tools/bin/fuseki.sh
                </pre>
		This script, like the following, assumes that the current version
		of Fuseki, for the moment <code>apache-jena-fuseki-2.4.0</code>, has
		been placed in the <code>aama/fuseki</code> directory, and that
		the file <code>tools/aamaconfig.ttl</code> has been copied
		to the Fuseki version directory; the
                scripts should be edited for the correct locations if this
		is not the case. When run for the first time, you will notice 
		that the script, which references the configuration file 
		<code>tools/aamaconfig.ttl</code>, will have placed a, 
		for the moment empty, data
		sub-directory <code>aama</code> in the 
		<code>fuseki/apache-jena-fuseki-2.4.0/</code> directory.
		</p>
	      <p>
		The following script:
		<pre>
 ~/aama $ tools/bin/aama-rdf2fuseki.sh "data/*"
                </pre>
		will load all the rdf files in <code>aama/data</code>
		into the Fuseki server. 
		</p>
	      <p>
		[NOTE: If the remote repository already
		has data loaded into its Fuseki server, the following script:
		<pre>
 ~/aama $ tools/bin/fudelete.sh "data/*"
                </pre>
		must be run first.]
		</p>
	  <p>
	    You can test the upload with the script: 
	    <pre>
~/aama $ tools/bin/fuqueries.sh
            </pre>
	    which runs the queries <code>count-triples.rq</code>
	    ("How many triples are there in the datastore?") and 
	    <code>list-graphs.rq</code> ("What are the URIs of the 
	    language subgraphs?"), from the directory 
	    <code>tools/sparql/rq-ru</code>.
	    If the upload has been successful, you will see an output such as
	    the following (assuming again that afar, geez, and yemsa are the 
	    languages which have been cloned into aama/data/).</p>

	    <li id="aamaquery">
	      <h5>Query SPARQL service</h5>
	      A SPARQL service can accessed to explore the morphological
	      data via three interfaces:
	      <ol>
		<li>
		  <h6>An AAMA command-line interface</h6>
		 <p>
		  (Some sample queries in <code>tools/sparql/rq-ru</code>
		  and scripts in <code>tools/bin</code>. An earlier version exists
		  with an extensive command-line application written in Perl.)</p>
		  </li>
		<li>
		  <h6>The Apache Jena Fuseki interface </h6>
		  <p>
		    You can see this on your browser at 
		    <code>localhost:3030</code> after you launch Fuseki. 
		    SPARQL queries, for example, those contained in the <code>
		      tools/sparql/rq-ru/</code> directory, can be run directly 
		    against the datastore 
		    in the Fuseki Control Panel on the 
		    <code>localhost:3030/dataset.html</code> page
		    (select the <code>/aama</code>
		    dataset when prompted). 
		  </p>
		  </li>
		<li>
		  <h6>A web application specifically oriented to AAMA data</h6>
		  <p>A preliminary menu-driven web application, will have
		    already been downloaded following the instructions outlined 
		    above in <a href="#datatools">Download data and tools</a>.
		    This application demonstrates the
		    use of SPARQL query templates for display and comparison of 
		    paradigms and morphosyntactic properties and categories. 
		    It is written in <a href="http://clojure.org/index">Clojure</a>,
		    a LISP dialect with a very involved
		    community of users who have created a formidable,
		    and constantly growing set of libraries. However essentially
		    the same functionality could be achieved by any software
		    framework which can provide a web interface for handling
		    SPARQL queries submitted to an  RDF datastore,
		  </p>
		  <p>The application presupposes that the Fuseki AAMA data server
		    has been launched through the invocation of the shell-script 
		    <code>bin/fuseki.sh</code>. At present 
		    the application can be run in the webapp directory, either
		    <ol><li>from the downloaded sorce-code, with the command 
			<code>lein ring server</code> using 
		  	<a href="http://leiningen.org">Leiningen</a></li>
		        <li> or as a Java application from the jar file to be 
			  found in the webapp directory, with
			  the command <code>java -jar aama-webapp.jar</code>.</li>
			</ol>
		  </p>
		  <p> In either case, the application will be seen on the browser 
		    at <code>localhost:3000</code>. 
		    Note that, in order to run, the application must be initialized 
		    in either case by generating/loading 
		    application-specific menu and index files,
		    following the steps detailed in the 
		    <code>Help > Initialize Application</code>  menu option.

		To ensure that your data and web app are up-to-date you should
		periodically run the following shell scripts, which assume that
		git has been installed and that the data and webapp have been
		cloned from the master version in the manner outlined above.
	      </p>
	      <p>The following script:
		<pre>

	      <p>Terminology Notes</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Term - we use "term" to refer to both "lxterms" (i.e. words) and "muterms" (i.e. morphs/morphemes).  A basic motivation is that we then get a kind of recursive structure: a term may consist of a minimal element (morph) or may be composed of other terms, so morphs, words, and multi-word structures (e.g. "has been eating") are treated equally as terms. </li>
	    <li>lxterm - a word or word-like unit of organization.  An lxterm may contain multiple words, e.g. English "has gone".</li>
	    <li>Lexeme - an abstraction that connects a collection of semantically related terms; the intuitive idea is that the "members" of a lexeme are like variations on a theme

	    <ul>
	      <li>"ordinary" lexemes like READ - joins (he) reads (present), (he) read (past), reading, etc.  In such cases the semantically related words are also related morphophonologically</li>
	      <li>"special" cases:

	      <ul>
		<li>suppletion - lexemes whose members are drawn from groups that are not related morphophonologically.  For example the lexeme GO contains (he) goes and (he) went - "went" comes from the archaic verb "wend" and is unrelated historically to the verb "go" (except via suppletion).  Another example is good - better.</li>
		<li>in some cases the relationship and etymology of the lexeme members may not be clear, but we put them in the same lexeme based on meaning/use. For example, pronouns are obviously similar in some sense but it's not clear what to do with them theoretically since they serve a great variety of functions in different languages.  We use a PRO lexeme in the archive for purely pragmatic purposes - it makes it easier to organize and manipulate the data.</li>
	      </ul>
	      </li>
	    </ul>
	    </li>
	    <li>muterm - a "morph", sub-word unit of organization; e.g. the 's' in "cats", 'en' in "wooden", 'ing' in "ranting", etc.</li>
	    <li>Morpheme - basically the morphemic counterpart to a lexeme.  Just as a lexeme can be thought of as a representation of a morpho-semantic class at the word level, the notion of morpheme is intended to represent such a class at the sub-word level.  Unfortunately the term "morpheme" is commonly used with several distinct senses; for example, /s/ and /z/ may be called morphemes, but one may also talk of the "plural morpheme" (just as one may talk of the GO lexeme).  For AAMA we would have a PL morpheme linking /s/ and /z/ muterms (or morphs).  Again, this is purely pragmatic; it makes it easier to organize and manipulate the data.</li>

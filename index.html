<p>Basic structure:</p>

<ul>
<li>Term - a basic element; covers both "word" and "morph" (on which, see below)</li>
<li>Lexeme - an abstraction that connects a collection of semantically related terms; the intuitive idea is that the "members" of a lexeme are like variations on a theme

<ul>
<li>"ordinary" lexemes like READ - joins (he) reads (present), (he) read (past), reading, etc.  In such cases the semantically related words are also related morphophonologically</li>
<li>"special" cases:

<ul>
<li>suppletion - lexemes whose members are drawn from groups that are not related morphophonologically.  For example the lexeme GO contains (he) goes and (he) went - "went" comes from the archaic verb "wend" and is unrelated historically to the verb "go" (except via suppletion).  Another example is good - better.</li>
<li>in some cases the relationship and etymology of the lexeme members may not be clear, but we put them in the same lexeme based on meaning/use. For example, pronouns are obviously similar in some sense but it's not clear what to do with them theoretically since they serve a great variety of functions in different languages.  We use a PRO lexeme in the archive for purely pragmatic purposes - it makes it easier to organize and manipulate the data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Morph - a sub-word unit of organization; e.g. the 's' in "cats", 'en' in "wooden", 'ing' in "ranting", etc.</li>
<li>Morpheme - basically the morphemic counterpart to a lexeme.  Just as a lexeme can be thought of as a representation of a morpho-semantic class at the word level, the notion of morpheme is intended to represent such a class at the sub-word level.  Unfortunately the term "morpheme" is commonly used with several distinct senses; for example, /s/ and /z/ may be called morphemes, but one may also talk of the "plural morpheme" (just as one may talk of the GO lexeme).  For AAMA we would have a PL morpheme linking /s/ and /z/ morphs.  Again, this is purely pragmatic; it makes it easier to organize and manipulate the data.</li>

	      <h6>Install and configure required software</h6>
	      <ol>
		<li>
		  <h6>Git client</h6>
		  <p>The aama project uses <a
		  href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> to store data
		  and tools; you'll need a git client in order to
		  download the tools repository and the data
		  repositories you're interested in.  Follow the
		  instructions at <a
		  href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-mac">Set
		  Up Git</a>.
		  </p>
		  <p>Note that you do not need to create a github
		  account unless you want to edit the data or code.
		  Instructions for how to do that are below.
		  </p>
		</li>
		<li>
		  <p>
		    Create and switch to an <code>aama</code> directory
		    structure on your local drive, e.g.
		    <pre>
~/ $ mkdir aama
~/ $ cd aama</pre>
		  </p>
		</li>
		<li>
		  <h6>rdf2rdf.jar</h6>
		  <p>We use this tool to convert RDF files to various
		  formats.  <a
		  href="http://www.l3s.de/~minack/rdf2rdf/">Download
		  it</a> and save it someplace convenient -
		  <code>~/aama/jar</code> is a good place.
		  </p>
		</li>
		<li>
		  <h6>aama-edn2ttl.jar</h6>
		  <p>The purpose of this jar file is to convert EDN-format 
		    data files (see below) to TTL format. 
		    You will find the file in <code>~/aama/tools/clj</code>, 
		    where you will also find its source-code. You should
		    move it to wherever you saved the rdf2rdf.jar file
		    (for example in <code>~/aama/jar</code>).
		  </p>
		</li>
		<li>
		  <h6>Fuseki</h6>
		  <p>
		    Fuseki is a SPARQL server.  <a
		    href="http://jena.apache.org/download/index.cgi">Download</a>
		    the <code>jena-fuseki-1.1.0-distribution</code>
		    distribution (either the zip file or the tar file)
		    and store it in a convenient location.
		    <code>~/aama/fuseki</code> is a good place.
		    Follow the <a
		    href="http://jena.apache.org/documentation/serving_data/#getting-started-with-fuseki">Getting
		    Started with Fuseki</a> instructions to install it
		    and verify that it runs.
		    <b>(TODO: more detailed instructions here...)</b>
		  </p>
		</li>
	      </ol>
	    </li>
	    <li id="datatools">
	      <h6>Download data and tools</h6>
	      <ul>
		<li>
		  <p>Take a look at the <a
		  href="https://github.com/aama">Aama repositories</a> and
		  decide which languages interest you.  In general we use
		  one repository per language, but since it is not always
		  easy to distinguish between languages and dialects,
		  sometimes we have multiple repositories per language
		  family, e.g. <a
		  href="https://github.com/aama/beja-arteiga">beja-arteiga</a>,
		  <a
		      href="https://github.com/aama/beja-bishari">beja-bishari</a>,
		  etc.
		  </p>
		  <p>Now you need to download the data to your local
		  harddrive.  Create a <code>data</code> directory
		  inside the <code>aama</code> directory,
		  e.g. <code>~/aama $ mkdir data</code>. Then clone
		  each language repository into the data directory:
		  </p>
		  <pre>
~/ $ cd aama/data
~/aama/data $ git clone https://github.com/aama/afar.git
~/aama/data $ git clone https://github.com/aama/geez.git
~/aama/data $ git clone https://github.com/aama/yemsa.git</pre>
		  <p>
		    Alternatively, you can create a personal github
		    account, <i>fork</i> the aama repositories (copy them
		    to your account), and then clone your repositories to
		    your local drive.  See <a
		    href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo">Fork
		    a Repo</a> for details.
		  </p>
		</li>
		<li>
		  <p>
		    In the same <code>aama</code> directory, clone the
		    aama <a href="https://github.com/aama/tools">tools
		    repository</a>.
		  </p>
		</li>
	      </ul>
	      <p>
		When you're done, your directory structure should look
		like this (assuming you have cloned afar, geez, and
		yemsa):
	      </p>
		<pre>
   aama
   |-data
   |---afar
   |---geez
   |---yemsa
   |-fuseki
   |-jar
   |-tools
		</pre>
	    </li>
	    <li id="ednformat">
	      <h6>The EDN morphological data format</h6>
	    </li>
	    <li id="rdfgen">
	      <h6>Generate RDF data from morphological data files</h6>
	    </li>
	    <li id="rdfupload">

	  <h4>Data Schema </h4>
	  <p>Basic structure:</p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>Term - we use "term" to refer to both "lxterms" (i.e. words) and "muterms" (i.e. morphs/morphemes).  A basic motivation is that we then get a kind of recursive structure: a term may consist of a minimal element (morph) or may be composed of other terms, so morphs, words, and multi-word structures (e.g. "has been eating") are treated equally as terms. </li>
	    <li>lxterm - a word or word-like unit of organization.  An lxterm may contain multiple words, e.g. English "has gone".</li>
	    <li>Lexeme - an abstraction that connects a collection of semantically related terms; the intuitive idea is that the "members" of a lexeme are like variations on a theme

	    <ul>
	      <li>"ordinary" lexemes like READ - joins (he) reads (present), (he) read (past), reading, etc.  In such cases the semantically related words are also related morphophonologically</li>
	      <li>"special" cases:

	      <ul>
		<li>suppletion - lexemes whose members are drawn from groups that are not related morphophonologically.  For example the lexeme GO contains (he) goes and (he) went - "went" comes from the archaic verb "wend" and is unrelated historically to the verb "go" (except via suppletion).  Another example is good - better.</li>
		<li>in some cases the relationship and etymology of the lexeme members may not be clear, but we put them in the same lexeme based on meaning/use. For example, pronouns are obviously similar in some sense but it's not clear what to do with them theoretically since they serve a great variety of functions in different languages.  We use a PRO lexeme in the archive for purely pragmatic purposes - it makes it easier to organize and manipulate the data.</li>
	      </ul>
	      </li>
	    </ul>
	    </li>
	    <li>muterm - a "morph", sub-word unit of organization; e.g. the 's' in "cats", 'en' in "wooden", 'ing' in "ranting", etc.</li>
	    <li>Morpheme - basically the morphemic counterpart to a lexeme.  Just as a lexeme can be thought of as a representation of a morpho-semantic class at the word level, the notion of morpheme is intended to represent such a class at the sub-word level.  Unfortunately the term "morpheme" is commonly used with several distinct senses; for example, /s/ and /z/ may be called morphemes, but one may also talk of the "plural morpheme" (just as one may talk of the GO lexeme).  For AAMA we would have a PL morpheme linking /s/ and /z/ muterms (or morphs).  Again, this is purely pragmatic; it makes it easier to organize and manipulate the data.</li>

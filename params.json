{"name":"Aama.github.io","tagline":"Afro-Asiatic Morphology Archive","body":"### Welcome to AAMA - the Afro-Asiatic Morphology Archive.\r\n\r\n\r\nBasic structure:\r\n\r\n* Term - a basic element; covers both \"word\" and \"morph\" (on which, see below)\r\n* Lexeme - an abstraction that connects a collection of semantically related terms; the intuitive idea is that the \"members\" of a lexeme are like variations on a theme\r\n  * \"ordinary\" lexemes like READ - joins (he) reads (present), (he) read (past), reading, etc.  In such cases the semantically related words are also related morphophonologically\r\n  * \"special\" cases:\r\n    * suppletion - lexemes whose members are drawn from groups that are not related morphophonologically.  For example the lexeme GO contains (he) goes and (he) went - \"went\" comes from the archaic verb \"wend\" and is unrelated historically to the verb \"go\" (except via suppletion).  Another example is good - better.\r\n    * in some cases the relationship and etymology of the lexeme members may not be clear, but we put them in the same lexeme based on meaning/use. For example, pronouns are obviously similar in some sense but it's not clear what to do with them theoretically since they serve a great variety of functions in different languages.  We use a PRO lexeme in the archive for purely pragmatic purposes - it makes it easier to organize and manipulate the data.\r\n* Morph - a sub-word unit of organization; e.g. the 's' in \"cats\", 'en' in \"wooden\", 'ing' in \"ranting\", etc.\r\n* Morpheme - basically the morphemic counterpart to a lexeme.  Just as a lexeme can be thought of as a representation of a morpho-semantic class at the word level, the notion of morpheme is intended to represent such a class at the sub-word level.  Unfortunately the term \"morpheme\" is commonly used with several distinct senses; for example, /s/ and /z/ may be called morphemes, but one may also talk of the \"plural morpheme\" (just as one may talk of the GO lexeme).  For AAMA we would have a PL morpheme linking /s/ and /z/ morphs.  Again, this is purely pragmatic; it makes it easier to organize and manipulate the data.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
